# 📚 Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my collection of **Java implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, developed as part of my ongoing learning and practice in problem-solving and algorithm design.

The goal of this repository is to consolidate important DSA concepts in one place, improve my coding proficiency in Java, and serve as a reference for future revisions or technical interviews.

## 📖 About This Repository

Throughout my computer science journey, I’ve been practicing numerous algorithms and data structures to strengthen my understanding of core concepts. This repository includes:

- Solutions to classic DSA problems.
- Implementations of fundamental data structures.
- Coding exercises from online judges (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeStudio, etc.).
- Comments and explanations in code for better readability and understanding.

While many solutions are straightforward, I’ve focused on writing **clean, readable, and efficient Java code** that adheres to best practices.
